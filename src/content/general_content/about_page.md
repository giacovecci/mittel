  Over the years I have worked on a broad range of projects: from [analysing pharma industry policy](https://www.politykainsight.pl/bibliotekaraportow/2101797,1,zdrowy-przemysl-reindustrializacja-krajowej-branzy-farmaceutycznej.read) to coordinating [strategy development at a major bank](https://www.aliorbank.pl/aktualnosci/2020-02-28-nowa-strategia.html), from aiding [government-level public consultations](https://www.press.pl/tresc/27406,debata-o-acta---dluga-i-nierozstrzygajaca) to running an impactful [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/politykainsight/sets/stan-epidemii)/[newsletter](https://www.press.pl/tresc/69328,polityka-insight-po-raz-ostatni-rozeslala-newsletter-_stan-epidemii_) combo during the COVID-19 pandemic.
