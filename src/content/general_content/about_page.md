  <span class="accent-text">### Background and Experience</span>


  With nearly 15 years of professional experience in research, journalism and project management, I am level-headed and responsible, while staying curious and creative.


  Over the years I have worked on a broad range of projects: from analysing pharma industry policy to coordinating strategy development at a major bank, from organising government-level public consultations to running an impactful podcast/newsletter combo during the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Originally from Gda≈Ñsk, Poland I graduated from the London School of Economics and Political Science as well as the National University of Singapore, with a concentration in social studies and public policy.
