  ## My approach


  I am driven by personal stories and global developments, making sense of both and sharing that which matters.


  I reach that which remains, and will remain, outside of search engine indexing and AI training data.


  I keep my cheer and open mind, while staying in control and thinking several steps ahead.


  ## What I offer


  * In-depth, well-structured, multi-lingual desk research and fixing

  * Broad network of experts and notable individuals, as well as interesting characters from all walks of life in Poland and Germany

  * Field research, interviewing and multi-lingual translating (Polish-German-English)

  * Creative idea consultation and fact-checking

  * Field audio and video recording, with own equipment

  * Video editing and post-production

  * On-the-ground transport and logistics coordination


  I work in English, Polish and German, I use Ukrainian and Russian too.


  ## Background and Experience


  With nearly 15 years of professional experience in research, journalism and project management, I am level-headed and responsible, while staying curious and creative.


  Over the years I have worked on a broad range of projects: from [analysing pharma industry policy](https://www.politykainsight.pl/bibliotekaraportow/2101797,1,zdrowy-przemysl-reindustrializacja-krajowej-branzy-farmaceutycznej.read) to coordinating [strategy development at a major bank](https://www.aliorbank.pl/aktualnosci/2020-02-28-nowa-strategia.html), from aiding [government-level public consultations](https://www.press.pl/tresc/27406,debata-o-acta---dluga-i-nierozstrzygajaca) to running an impactful [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/politykainsight/sets/stan-epidemii)/[newsletter](https://www.press.pl/tresc/69328,polityka-insight-po-raz-ostatni-rozeslala-newsletter-_stan-epidemii_) combo during the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Since 2022 I focus on production for media organisations as well as developing and producing my own content. 


  Originally from Gda≈Ñsk, Poland I graduated from the London School of Economics and Political Science as well as the National University of Singapore, with a concentration in social studies and public policy.
