      I worked for the New York Times Opinion Audio team, accompanying Masha
      Gessen in their reporting in Poland.


      My tasks included chiefly location sound recording of about 20 interviews and ambience, as well as local fixing, driving and translating.


      The piece and its accompanying podcast are pending.
