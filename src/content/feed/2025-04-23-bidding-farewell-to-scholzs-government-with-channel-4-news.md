      I worked with Channel 4 News covering the no-confidence vote, which ended
      the "traffic-light" coalition government in Germany. Coincidentally, in
      the same week we witnessed the collapse of the Assad regime, so our piece
      bridged the two developments through reaching out to members of Berlin's
      vibrant Syrian community. My tasks included preliminary research, location
      scouting and fact-checking; local fixing (interviewees and locations) and
      scheduling; translations and field production.


      Team highlights included: presenting the evening programme from inside the Reichstag building; following a provocative far-right demonstration, and the clashes with counter-protesters; running vox pops on Sonnenallee, in the heart of Berlin's multiethnic Neuk√∂lln district and among the patrons of Berlin Philharmonic; accessing AfD's parliamentary whip, Dr Berndt Baumann.
