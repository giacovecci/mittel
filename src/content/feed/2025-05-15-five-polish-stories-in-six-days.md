      I worked with [Lenora
      Chu](https://www.csmonitor.com/About/People/Lenora-Chu), the Monitor's
      Special Correspondent, to provide a nuanced view of the post-election
      transformation of the Polish state institutions and society. After eight
      years of increasingly illiberal rule of Law and Justice, a new
      center-right coalition set out to return to *status quo ante*. Or was it?


      To make sense of the intentions and actions of the new government, we spend several busy days interviewing journalists, politicians, experts and ordinary Poles.


      My engagement included:


      * researching themes and characters

      * managing access and logistics

      * translating interviews (on location and in post)

      * photographing the characters

      * post-production fact-checking and liaising with the characters
