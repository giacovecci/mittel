      I worked with Channel 4 News team to cover the German federal election. My
      tasks included preliminary research and fact-checking; local fixing
      (interviewees and locations) and scheduling; translations and field
      production.


      Team highlights included: successfully arranging last-minute access to a final pre-election event with Friedrich Merz, including presenting on-site during the event; gaining access to some of the key AfD politicians, including Alice Weidel, Beatrix von Storch (long-form studio interview) and Rene Springer (on-location interview); safely accessing two AfD rallies and gaining relevant vox pops; securing valuable live guests on a very short notice.
