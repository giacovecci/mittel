      The AfD has been posed to score big in the 2024 regional elections in
      several German states. Could this be a sign of things to come at the
      federal level?


      I helped Matt Frei's Channel 4 News crew seek out the answers on AfD's campaign trail, and we definitely went further than most international journalists.


      Forst, a remote town near the Polish border, seemed like a non-obvious destination, but it paid off: we accessed a notoriously suspicious crowd and gathered some excellent footage and interviews.


      My responsibilities included:


      * preliminary research and fixing

      * securing access to AfD's campaign event in a remote Brandenburg town (as the only TV crew)

      * securing interview with AfD's regional lead candidate

      * liaising with party officials and ensuring crew safety during voxpops

      * fact-checking and translations
