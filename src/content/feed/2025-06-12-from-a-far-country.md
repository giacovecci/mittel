      The presidential election has been Poland's political event of the year so
      far and rightly so: the vote seems decisive to the outlook for Donald
      Tusk's government and the country's internal and international
      trajectories.


      Qatar's Alaraby TV, a leading outlet in the Gulf region and beyond, wished to bring their audiences up to speed with the arguably somewhat exotic themes that move Polish people. I worked with their European correspondent, [Muath Hamed](https://x.com/MuathHamed), to deliver a comprehensive yet not overwhelming coverage of the vote.


      My responsibilities involved both field production and videography, while Muath took care of editing.
