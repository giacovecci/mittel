      I accompanied Samira Atei, a foreign correspondent for the Belgian daily
      De Standaard, on an assignment covering the flooding in the Polish region
      of Lower Silesia.


      My responsibilities included preliminary research and planning, local fixing (interviews and locations), translating, security and logistics.


      We managed to reach and report from some hard to reach heavily-affected locations, including Stronie Śląskie and Lewin Brzeski; tie in national politics, by accessing the former mayor of Wrocław Bogdan Zdrojewski as well as Paweł Kukiz, who we met serendipitously volunteering in his home town; and give voice to a number of horrendously affected local residents.
