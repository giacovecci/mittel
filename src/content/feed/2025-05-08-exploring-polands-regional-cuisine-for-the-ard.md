      I researched and organised a four-day shoot at four locations for a
      culinary documentary commissioned by the German public television
      (ARD/SWR).


      My engagement included: 


      * researching themes and potential characters 

      * fixing shoot dates and locations

      * co-managing logistics

      * translating interviews (on location and in post)

      * shooting BTS

      * post-production fact-checking and liaising with the characters

      <span class="accent-text">Personal note:</span> I was extremely happy with
      how the piece came together - all of our characters were amazing, very
      open and generous with access, while the team did a top job of making them
      look and sound their best.


      The documentary is a part of series produced by Alpha Container Pictures, available here: https://www.ardmediathek.de/sendung/Y3JpZDovL3N3ci5kZS9zZGIvc3RJZC8xNzMw
