      I accompanied [Rob
      Schmitz](https://www.npr.org/people/493268904/rob-schmitz) during his
      summer tour of Poland's hotspots: the border with Belarus and Civic
      Platform's campaign trail. We travelled from Warsaw to Olsztyn via
      Białystok and Białowieża to gauge the anxieties and excitements, on the
      brink of a political change and perhaps also a conflict with a
      neighbouring regime.\

      \

      My responsibilities included:


      * preliminary research and fixing

      * on-the-ground fixing and translating

      * videography for social media

      * fact-checking
