      David French invited Aleksandra Gliszczy≈Ñska-Grabias, a law professor at
      the Polish Academy of Sciences, to share her insights about
      re-establishing the rule of law following an authoritarian turn. Perhaps
      the Polish experience could have relevance for those envisioning a
      post-Trumpian era?


      Since Aleksandra was in Warsaw and David was not, I played a small but important part in helping them sound like they were in the same room. My role was location sound recording with a foolproof setup.


      The full transcript of the conversation is [available here](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/poland-democracy-us.html).
