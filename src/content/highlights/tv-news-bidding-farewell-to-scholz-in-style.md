summary: >-
  Ahead of the pivotal federal election I provided the necessary local
  expertise, contacts and production assistance, for exciting and poignant
  Channel 4 News coverage.


  Together with Matt Frei's team we spanned the worlds of parliamentary politics, societal tension and deep questions about Germany's present and future.


  And there's still so many more stories to tell!
