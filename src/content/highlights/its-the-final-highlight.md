summary: >-
  Fancy a taste of real Poland? Traditional dishes made with love in some of
  Europe's most pristine nature? So did my client and I helped produce the next
  best thing to taking the trip yourself.


  For "So isst Masuren!", a culinary documentary now streaming in ARD Mediathek, I researched themes, locations, characters and the dishes themselves, and then accompanied the team over the four shoot days, translating and liaising with the characters.


  *Smacznego!*
